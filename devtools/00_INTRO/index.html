                <h1 id="overview">Overview</h1>
<p>This is the knowledge base for our DevTools project. The goal of DevTools is to provide consistent environments &amp; tooling for our teams to enable delivery of the highest quality work for our clients.</p>
<h2 id="background-whats-in-it-for-you">Background / What’s in it for you?</h2>
<p>DevTools covers an entire toolbox of solutions to accelerate development and smoothly implement best practices.  We intend to use the DevTools umbrella to help us roll these tools and approaches out to the whole company in a more consistent fashion.</p>
<p>Across a wide variety of projects and clients, keeping a development, integration, staging, production and other environments synchronized in terms of server configuration and supporting software versions and tooling has always been a challenge. The multitude of platforms and versions of operating systems and software is only growing. In the past we have used Vagrant in conjunction with a virtual machine (VM) for local development environments, project-based VMs on Dev Cloud for integration environments and tools like Puppet to try and ensure all of those match each other and the deployment environments. </p>
<p>It’s been better than doing it all by hand but it has required building additional expertise above typical system management tools and it’s relatively inefficient to have many project-specific VMs locally. On top of that are the various, sometimes conflicting, versions of development toolchains which the VMs don’t always address.</p>
<p>DevTools is going to address this problem by providing an efficient way to have project/app-specific environments as well as development tooling by using a concept called containerization. This lets us focus on items at a service-and-tools level rather than at a server level and make the details of our hosting implementation more transparent to all technical team members .</p>
<h2 id="containerization">Containerization</h2>
<p>In order to provide lightweight environments and tooling we will be using a technical approach called containers.  Containers attempt to move the unit of environment from server to application. This allows separation of concerns between how an application is configured, how the containers communicate with each other, and where the containers are deployed.  Take an advanced Drupal stack that includes Apache/PHP, MySQL, Memcache, and SOLR. With each component configured to run in its own container, the containers can all run on a single VM for local development and be spread across multiple servers for an optimized production deployment. Let us briefly touch on the technology we will be using and how it conceptually fits together.</p>
<h3 id="docker">Docker</h3>
<p>The container implementation we use is called Docker which is explained in the intro: <a href="https://www.docker.com/whatisdocker">What is Docker</a>? This is the way we capture environment units for our application/services and share them with everyone on the team.  Environments are captured as images, similar to a VM, so when anyone runs that image they all start with the exact same set of files. For example, nearly every Phase2 project needs a web server so we have a container image that can be run to provide that service. </p>
<h4 id="glossary">Glossary</h4>
<p>For those that want a bit more detail </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Host Machine</strong> - Your laptop for the purposes of DevTools. This is where your project's source code, your IDE, browsers, etc run as well as where the virtual machine acting as the Docker Host runs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Docker Host</strong> - This is a Linux-based virtual machine capable of running Docker. One Docker host VM can run multiple containers for multiple projects.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Docker Image</strong> - A read only template that can be instantiated as a running container. An image might supply a service as small as a build tool or as large as a database and/or web server. Images are generally single purpose in nature and are then linked together to build more complex capabilities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Container</strong> - A runtime instance of a Docker Image. This is what contains a service like Apache or MySQL. Several containers can run on a single Docker Host and they can be linked so that they they know how to communicate with each other.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="docker-machine">Docker Machine</h3>
<p>Docker Machine creates the Docker Host virtual machine in which containers run.  This provides the functionality that we previously used Vagrant to accomplish. Under the covers docker-machine starts up a virtual machine running a tiny version of Linux.  On Macs this tiny version of Linux is called boot2docker.  All of the Docker commands to build and run containers will actually be executed on the boot2docker virtual machine. On your laptop you will have a single boot2docker virtual machine (running in VirtualBox or VMWare Fusion) and it will host one or more Docker containers. Each project will likely have multiple Docker containers running (web server, database, memcache, search, etc.).</p>
<h3 id="docker-compose">Docker Compose</h3>
<p>Docker Compose is used to manage and coordinate the containers that need to run for a project in an easy to use YAML file. Each project will have a docker-compose file for each Docker environment that the project supports.  For example, the default docker-compose.yml would be used to start containers for local development, and alternate Docker compose files could be included for starting containers for the integration/stage and other environments.</p>
